<h3> 3 key feature about myself:</h3>
<ul><li>Good listener</li>
	<li>A korean drama lover</li>
	<li>Introvert in public but very loud with my close one</li>
	<li>Additional feature: Love to eat a lots</li></center>
</ul>


<p> Based on the three key feature I list above, I'am not actually think that I'am a good listener but seeing how my friend would talk comfortably with me about their personal matter and their problem makes me wonder maybe I'am a good listener at least for my friends and the ones who needs me. Plus, being a listener itself is not that bad. I get to know how others feel and how  people can do to face their problem. This make me thinks that not only me myself who struggle in life but others also facing their own struggle but with different situation.  </p>

<p>The second key about myself is I'am really in love with korean drama. I have been into kdrama since 2013 until now. Kdrama really get me throught the day when I feel stressed or feel down so I would watch any type of kdrama that I love. One of my favorite kdrama is Strong girl Do Bong-Soon. This drama tell about a girl who was born with a superhuman strenght and she's desperately want to hide her superpower to be a elegant woman like everybody because she's think its normal. The genre is a comedy fantasy with action thriller so I think it's suitable to watch for all kind of age even our grandparent. I rated for 10 over 10 for this drama because the storyline, the actors and actress was superb and amusing. I'am not gonna turn my personal bio into a kdrama review so I'll stop here. </p>

<p>Last but not least is how I would turn into introvert at public but actually loud with the one who close with me. I'am not gonna lie that I got so insecured with many people around me especially when they're better, smarter and prettier tham me. But when I'm with my family and friends my mood would change 100%. Its like I found life and make me a new person everytime. I thought this is the best in relationship, people who know me well tend to be the most supportive people and would be incomplete without them. Online learning at home is not that easy. You have to be very independant and have a strong mental to got through. This odl also makes me eat a lot than before whenever I have time or when I was doing my assignment, food would never leave me alone so I guess eating can make me happy too. </p>

<h4> So, I guess that all from me. There's no special things in me because I just a normal person like everyone who want to complete her Bachelor in Office Systems Management (HONS.) proudly for myself and my mother. If anyone have any enquires please reach me through email sitiamirah992@gmail.com. Thankyou and stay safe everyone!</h4>
